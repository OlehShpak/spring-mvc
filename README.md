# Spring (MVC + Security + Data) project (full java configured, without xml) 
This is not big, but pretty CRM system. It helps to practice some features in endless spring framework

Entry point http://localhost:8080/spring-brightcrm

Don't forget change your db properties (under src/main/resources) and add your JDBC Driver to POM  

Done:
- Authorization and authentication are provided by Spring Security
- Unauthorized users have access only to hello page, login and registration forms
- During registration user data is validating for uniqueness, password encoded by BCrypt
- Registered users receive role "user", hence access to all sections except chief section (needed role "chief")
- User(e.g. employee) can create,delete and search customers (new customers are validating for uniqueness)
- User can create,delete and search deals (search in custom date range by created date or deadline)
- Customer and deals are related One To Many, customer is deleted with deal collection (cascade)
- User can receive and view tasks from another users and accomplish it
- ORM framework is Hibernate, db properties are for Postgresql
- Repositories are created by Spring Data
- For validation model constraints is used Hibernate Validator
- Frontend provided by JSP, JSTL, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 
- Controllers are tested by Mockito
- Added controller and service performance measuring with Spring AOP
- For logging is used SLF4J (console, file output path: ${catalina.home}/logs/shpak.log )
- Project is built by Maven, required web server for Servlet 3.0.1 (e.g. Tomcat 7 and higher)

TODO:
- Add more analytics reports (implement some OLAP queries)
- Implement global news for all users
- Add email sending service
- Deal forecasting
